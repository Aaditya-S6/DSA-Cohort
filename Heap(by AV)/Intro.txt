A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. Generally, Heaps can be of two types:

Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.

Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree. . 


Identification-
1-K given hoga
2-smallest ya largest
Agar ye dono ek sath aati hain,means ques heap
ka hai.


Two types of heap-
1-Min heap -Min element top pe rhta hai
2-Max heap - Max element top p rhta hai

When to use what?
K+Smallest  given hai---> Max heap use krenge
K+Largest given hai----> Min heap use krenge

Heap ke ques saare Sorting ke ques hote hain,
k diya hota hai to ham k size ka heap bna lete
hai to jo complexity hai vo nlogn se nlogk ho 
jati hai.
